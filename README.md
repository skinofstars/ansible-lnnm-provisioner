### Ansible provisioning roles ###

This is a collection of Ansible roles that can be used for provisioning Ubuntu
web servers. They are intentionally kept focused on a single environment.

Many roles will work alone, but some need others to work. I'm afraid you'll have
to check that out yourself to see what's going to work well for you.

Just create a base playbook and select each role you want to use.

Check the playbook.yml in the root of this project for an example usage.

Bug reports happily received.
